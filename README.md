# CVE to EPSS

A simple one-page web app that allows users to enter a CVE ID (e.g. `CVE-1999-0001`) and fetch EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System) data via the [FIRST.org EPSS API](https://first.org/epss/).

I really just wanted a quick way to see the EPSS data for a single CVE ID.

It's not meant to be an all-encompassing app (and never will be).
